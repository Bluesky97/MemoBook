# MemoBook
This is under university assignment (individual project). To create a mobile application by using Xamarin Android (C#). MemoBook is a simple mobile application for user to post a timeline by using text, photo and check-in location. This keeps track of the posts on what the user have done. It also allows users to see their own profile which is easily updated into the database. This mobile application has a similar idea to Facebook, but the mobile application can operation offline, meaning no connection through the internet is required to post the text and photo. Only checking in through the location is required to for the user to connect through the internet to obtain the latitude and longitude based on the Google Maps API. Therefore, the features are very useful in knowing where the users are.

To run this project:
Start the project from the MobileApps.csproj files (as I do not include the solution files of Visual Studio).
